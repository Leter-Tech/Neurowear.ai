**Empowering individuals with epilepsy to live with greater independence, confidence, and safety.**

Neurowear.ai is a revolutionary solution for individuals with epilepsy, providing **seizure detection**, **health tracking**, and **safety assurance** through advanced wearable technology. Our mission is to empower those affected by epilepsy to live with greater independence and confidence.



## The Problem 🚨

Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that affects millions worldwide, presenting challenges for both individuals and their caregivers:
- **Sudden Seizures**: Risk of injuries, accidents, and life-threatening situations such as drowning or road accidents.

- **Daily Limitations**: Fear of seizures restricts personal freedom, social interactions and professional opportunities.

- **Insecurity**: Many individuals refrain from activities like hiking, swimming, or working in vulnerable places like construction sites.

- **Outdated Solutions**: Current methods for seizure management lack accuracy and modern-day usability.



## What is Neurowear.ai? 💭

Neurowear.ai is an **AI-powered wearable solution** designed to address the unique challenges faced by individuals with epilepsy:
1. **Detects Seizures**: Highly accurate wearable devices identify early signs of seizures.

2. **Ensures Safety**: Headband provides timely warnings 30-45 minutes before seizures and instantly notifies caregivers.

3. **Tracks Health**: Monitors daily activity, including heart rate, SpO2, steps, and stress levels.

4. **User-Friendly App**: Offers seizure logs, medicine reminders, diet planning, and seizure management tips.

## How It Works 🛠️

### The Wearable Ecosystem
1. **Headband**:
   - Equipped with **EEG sensors** to measure neural activity and detect abnormal patterns.
   - Provides early seizure warnings, making it ideal for use during risky activities like driving or swimming.

2. **Smartband**:
   - Monitors **heart rate, body temperature, oxygen saturation**, and more using specialized sensors:
     - **EMG Sensor**: Detects rapid muscle contractions.
     - **EDA Sensor**: Measures skin conductance and stress levels.
     - **IR Sensor**: Tracks body temperature and SpO2.
     - **Accelerometer and Gyroscope**: Detects falls and step counts.

3. **Mobile App**:
   - Displays seizure logs, health activity, and personalized seizure management recommendations.
   - Features **medicine reminders**, **diet planners**, and **emergency alerts**.

## AI-Powered Seizure Detection 🤖

Our sophisticated AI model tailors itself to individual symptoms, minimizing false positives and improving accuracy:
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** Neural Network for seizure detection.
- **Hidden Markov Model (HMM)** for sleep scoring and activity tracking.
- **Weight Adjustment**: Major symptoms like neural activity and oxygen saturation are prioritized over others.

### Example:
- Symptoms during seizures:
  - High neural activity (EEG)
  - Low oxygen saturation (IR sensor)
  - Mild Muscle contractions (EMG sensor)
- Relevant sensors are dynamically weighted for accurate detection using AI.
